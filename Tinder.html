      <h1>How to create an account?</h1>
      <p>
        The creation of a Tinder account can be done via the Facebook profile or with an SMS-enabled mobile phone number.
        When the Facebook profile is used to log in, Tinder accesses the user's first name and age as profile information and selects five photos of the user as profile pictures.
        The photos can be selected individually via the Facebook profile or via your own gallery.
        In addition, users can describe themselves individually with a short text.
        Tinder also uses users' likes and friend lists to show similarities between two people.

      <h1>History of Tinder</h1>
      <p>
        Tinder was first distributed on the campus of the University of Southern California.
        60 percent of users use the program every day in 2013, many of them using it several times a day.
        Since November 2014, as of version 4.0.0, it is possible to cancel the last choice and the location can also be set manually.
        However, these two features can only be unlocked by paying an amount that varies from user to user via in-app purchase.
        The amount to unlock the so-called Tinder Plus membership amounts, according to Tinder co-founder Jonathan baths to $ 20 per month.
        With the function extension Tinder Gold, the user can see which members already "like" him and so can influence his own matches faster.
        The Tinder Gold function can only be activated with Tinder Plus already active and costs an additional five euros.

      <h1>Particularities of Tinder</h1>
      <p>
        Using the Facebook profile, Tinder receives the basic information about the user.
        To optimize the person suggestions, the Tinder algorithm analyzes the profile information and behavior when using the app and places them in an app's "ELO leader board".
        This ranking provides information on how well you arrive at your fellow human beings.
        The number of matches is a significant part of this process, but other factors, such as the amount of information that users use to customize their profile, determine the final place in this ranking.
        From the ranking, Tinder promises to be able to increase the hit rate of their users.
        A special role is played by the geographical location, the number of mutual friends and common interests.
        Only after both users have identified each other as attractive, they can chat with each other.
        In this way, users have control over who can write to them, and they are not confronted with messages from people they did not previously rate as attractive.
        Actions within Tinder are not reported on the user's Facebook profile.
        With Tinder's Matchmaker feature, users can connect between two of their Facebook friends without them seeing all their information.

        According to a ProSiebenSat1 report in 2016 for Galileo, every day 1.4 billion so-called "swipes" are made to the left or right to rate profile photos.
