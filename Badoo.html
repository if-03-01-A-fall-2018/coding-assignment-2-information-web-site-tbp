         Badoo is an international online community.
         The portal was developed by Russian entrepreneur Andrey Andreev and has existed since 2006.
         The company is based in London's Soho district.
         In April 2011, Badoo reached 114 million registered users.
         In addition to the web version of the community, Badoo also offers its own smartphone applications for the iPhone, Windows Phone and Android devices.
         The iPhone app is the most commonly used flirt app for the iPhone, while the Android users prefer two other apps before the Badoo app.
         Just over a year later, it was rated sixth among the world's most valuable social media brands, with a brand value of $ 3.7 billion, according to a study by the HWZ Zurich School of Economics and the BV4 Brand Value Rating Agency brand consultancy.
         The site is financed by a freemium model, that is, basic functions of contacting are free, optimized search functions are charged.
         Badoo is blocked in the United Arab Emirates and in Iran.
         According to single dating scam report Badoo has the highest scam volume compared to other dating and social dating portals.

            With these you can find people who suit you well.
          </li>
          <li>
            You'll then see suggestions with people in your area.
            You can also start targeted searches.
            If you are interested in getting to know someone, you can simply contact them.

      <p>
        After the rough profile setup you should first upload one or more photos of yourself.
        These are checked for suitability according to the website.
        If the profile picture is appealing, you hardly need anything else to do as a woman - our mailbox was flooded with dating messages after a few hours.
        Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to fill out the profile and the further information about you, because then you can also see the information of other users, such as where and what they work.
        The contact was also very easy and pleasant in our test.
        The cover letter and chat in the app was not a problem and within a few seconds came back already an answer.
